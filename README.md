# Zyven: Distributed Reliability Middleware
> **Eliminate Webhook Data Loss.** Zyven is a high-performance middleware that guarantees at-least-once delivery between your core services and external endpoints.

## 🧐 The Engineering Problem
Calling external webhooks directly from your API creates a **tight coupling** and a **single point of failure**:
- ❌ **Downstream Downtime**: If the receiver is down, your data is lost.
- ❌ **Latency Spikes**: Waiting for a slow webhook response blocks your core API.
- ❌ **Zombies**: Failed events without logs are impossible to debug.

**Zyven acts as a shock absorber.** It separates **Acceptance** (Sync & Fast) from **Delivery** (Async & Reliable).

## 🏗️ System Architecture
Zyven is built for high availability and strict security isolation.

---

## 🔄 Lifecycle: The Reliability Boundary
Once Zyven commits an event to the source-of-truth database, we take **100% ownership** of its delivery.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **🛡️ Idempotency Protection**: Never process the same event twice, even if the client retries the request.
- **🔄 Intelligent Retries**: Exponential backoff with jitter and configurable retry limits.
- **💀 Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Failed events are automatically isolated for manual inspection and bulk replay.
- **🔐 HMAC Webhook Signing**: Every delivery includes a cryptographic signature for security validation.
- **🔍 Full Visibility**: Audit logs for every single HTTP attempt, including response headers and body.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL (Persistence) + Redis (Queueing)
- **Logic**: BullMQ (Job Scheduling) + Prisma/Drizzle (ORM)
- **Security**: Dedicated Outgoing Proxy for SSRF protection
